# Weather Observation Station 3

Query a list of **CITY** names from **STATION** for cities that have an even **ID** number. Print the results in any order, but exclude duplicates from the answer.  
The **STATION** table is described as follows:

where **LAT\_N** is the northern latitude and **LONG\_W** is the western longitude.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT CITY
FROM STATION
WHERE ID % 2 = 0;
```

- `ID % 2 = 0`: the remainder of dividing by 2 is 0, so the ID is even (`MOD(ID, 2) = 0` also works in MySQL).
- `DISTINCT` removes duplicate city names.
