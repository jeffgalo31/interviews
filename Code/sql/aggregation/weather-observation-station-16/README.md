Query the smallest *Northern Latitude* (*LAT\_N*) from **STATION** that is greater than $38.7780$. Round your answer to $4$ decimal places.

**Input Format**

The **STATION** table is described as follows:

<img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/9336/1449345840-5f0a551030-Station.jpg" title="Station.jpg" />

where *LAT\_N* is the northern latitude and *LONG\_W* is the western longitude.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT ROUND(MIN(LAT_N), 4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N > 38.7780;
```

- Smallest value **above** the limit: filter, then `MIN`, then round.
