You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too! 

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the _hacker\_id_, _name_, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending _hacker\_id_. Exclude all hackers with a total score of $0$ from your result.

**Input Format**

The following tables contain contest data:

- _Hackers:_ The _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker, and _name_ is the name of the hacker. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19503/1458522826-a9ddd28469-ScreenShot2016-03-21at6.40.27AM.png"/>

- _Submissions:_ The _submission\_id_ is the id of the submission, _hacker\_id_ is the id of the hacker who made the submission, _challenge\_id_ is the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and _score_ is the score of the submission. <img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19503/1458523022-771511df90-ScreenShot2016-03-21at6.40.37AM.png"/>

**Sample Output**

```
4071 Rose 191
74842 Lisa 174
84072 Bonnie 100
4806 Angela 89
26071 Frank 85
80305 Kimberly 67

**Explanation**

> The explanation on HackerRank uses formulas that don't copy as text; see the [problem page](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/contest-leaderboard/problem). The Solution section below walks through it.

## Solution

```sql
SELECT h.hacker_id, h.name, SUM(m.max_score) AS total_score
FROM Hackers h
JOIN (
    SELECT hacker_id, challenge_id, MAX(score) AS max_score
    FROM Submissions
    GROUP BY hacker_id, challenge_id
) m ON h.hacker_id = m.hacker_id
GROUP BY h.hacker_id, h.name
HAVING total_score > 0
ORDER BY total_score DESC, h.hacker_id;
```

- Step 1 (subquery): best score per hacker per challenge, so retries don't count twice.
- Step 2: sum those best scores per hacker.
- `HAVING total_score > 0` removes hackers whose total is 0.
